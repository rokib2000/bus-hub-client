          <p>
            There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:
            <br /> <br />
            Local state <br />
            Global state <br />
            Server state <br />
            URL state

          <p>
            Prototypal inheritance is a feature of JavaScript used to add methods and properties to objects. It is a
            method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, to get
            and set the [[prototype]] of an object, we use the object. getPrototypeOf and object.

          <p>
            The main purpose of unit testing is to isolate written code and determine whether it works as intended. Unit
            testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help identify
            early errors in code that may be more difficult to find in later testing phases.

          <p>
            There are three frameworks for building web applications that every frontend developer has heard of: React,
            Vue.js, and Angular.
            <br />
            <br />
            React is a UI library, Angular is a fully developed front-end framework and Vue.js is a progressive
            framework.
            <br />
            <br />
            They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but they are not 100 percent the
            same, so it makes sense to compare them and understand their differences.
            <br />
            <br />
            Each framework is component-oriented and allows rapid creation of UI features.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, they all have different structures and architectures â€” so first, we'll look at their architectural
            differences to understand the philosophy behind them.
